There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area -
