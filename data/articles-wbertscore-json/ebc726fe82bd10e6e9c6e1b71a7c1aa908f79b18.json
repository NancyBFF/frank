With the pair finalising their preparations for the fight at the MGM Grand on May 2, Top Rank promoter Arum told\u00a0ESPN that the contracts have still not been finalised. Tickets for the bout have also yet to go on sale and Arum claimed that the draft contract he received on April 15 was not what he agreed with Mayweather Promotions and MGM when the term sheet was signed a few months ago. Bob Arum has revealed that the contracts for the mega fight next weekend have yet to be signed Top Rank boss Arum is promoter for Manny Pacquiao and he said the contract hasn't yet been signed 'We agreed that we would all be signatories on the final contract and then they sent us a draft of the agreement and it excluded us,' Arum said. Not being a signatory would mean that Top Rank wouldn't have control of decisions such as video content and music during the fight. 'They don't want us to have any say,' Arum added. 'That's what we're enmeshed in.'

He said: 'The bottom line is that Bob isn't willing to live with the agreement signed a couple months ago, which doesn't allow him to be in control.
