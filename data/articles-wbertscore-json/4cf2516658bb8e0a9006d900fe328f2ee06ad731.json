Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. Scroll down for video CLAIM: MP Jesse Norman is being investigated by police over claims he attempted to 'bribe' voters with chocolate cake, pictured above Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as \u2018nonsense\u2019, saying: \u2018We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.\u2019 The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. The 57-year-old has criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous'  investigation after he was told he will face no further action. Mr Rose said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls. 'They told me I have got to watch anything I do. So I'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I'm going to run a mile.'
