Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final. It will be interesting to see what happens in the summer.'
