Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police. Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban. Police in KwaZulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted. They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her. A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room. The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's\u00a0Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission.\u00a0We worked very closely together. She loved her work with children. 'This really was an act of savagery against a gentle, caring soul.' Sister Gertrud had lived at the missionary for 60 years after moving to South Africa from her native Austria. Police spokesman Major Thulani Zwane said there were no signs of forced entry into the room - and the number of intruders was 'unclear'. 'It is alleged that the victim was at her residence when she was approached by a suspect who allegedly tied her hands with a typewriter cord,' he added. 'She was also covered with a towel over her face, causing the victim to suffocate. Rape is also suspected in this matter. 'We are following all leads. We are also appealing to the community to come forward with any information.' Nuns at the mission where the murdered sister lived have been serving the local community since 1923 The attack at the weekend is the first to be reported at the mission, which opened in 1923 for nuns wanting to serve the local community. It is also a home for young women who are considering becoming nuns. Sister Gerald, who lives at the mission, said Sister Gertrud had dedicated her life to helping impoverished children and adolescents. Despite her advanced age, she was working for the mission's educational outreach programme at the time of her murder. 'She had a very kind heart and was loved by everyone,' said Sister Gerald.", "entity_counter": {"Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher": 1, "her bedroom": 2, "a towel": 3, "her face": 2, "An 86-year-old nun": 1, "the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo": 2, "Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands": 1, "a typewriter cord": 2, "a face": 1, "local police": 1, "Her body": 1, "other nuns": 1, "the Sacred Heart Missionary": 1, "Ixopo": 1, "a small town": 1, "85 miles south-west": 1, "Durban": 1, "Police": 1, "KwaZulu-Natal": 1, "the results": 1, "forensic tests": 1, "Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher\u00a0(not pictured)": 2, "how many men": 1, "A small sum": 1, "money": 1, "euros": 1, "her room": 1, "The victim's friend": 1, "Betty Firmstone": 1, "South Africa's\u00a0Daily News": 1, "Sister": 1, "a school": 1, "the mission": 3, "her work": 1, "children": 1, "an act": 1, "savagery": 1, "a gentle, caring soul": 1, "South Africa's": 1, "her native Austria": 1, "Police spokesman Major Thulani Zwane": 1, "no signs": 1, "forced entry": 1, "the room": 1, "the number": 1, "intruders": 1, "The victim": 2, "her residence": 1, "a suspect": 1, "her hands": 1, "Rape": 1, "this matter": 1, "all leads": 1, "the community": 3, "any information": 1, "Nuns": 1, "the murdered sister": 1, "The attack": 1, "nuns": 2, "a home": 1, "young women": 1, "Sister Gerald": 2, "the mission where the murdered sister lived": 1, "Sister Gertrud": 1, "her life": 1, "impoverished children": 1, "adolescents": 1, "her advanced age": 1, "the mission's educational outreach programme": 1, "the time": 1, "her murder": 1, "a very kind heart": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher 's hands were tied with a typewriter cord .", "A towel was placed over her face , causing her to suffocate , say police .", "Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary .", "Police are waiting for forensic tests to confirm she was sexually assaulted ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["sister gertrud tiefenbacher 's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face , say police .", "her body was found by other nuns at the sacred heart missionary in ixopo , a small town 85 miles south-west of durban .", "a small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room .", "the victim 's friend betty firmstone , 85 , said : ` this really was an act of savagery against a gentle , caring soul ' ."], "bus_lines": ["gertrud tiefenbacher 's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord .", "her body was found by other nuns at the sacred heart missionary in ixopo .", "they say she was suffocated", "but they are unsure how many men attacked her ."], "pgn_lines": ["gertrud tiefenbacher 's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel on her face .", "her body was found at the sacred heart missionary in ixopo , a small town 85 miles south-west of durban .", "police in kwazulu-natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that sister gertrud was sexually assaulted ."], "s2s_lines": ["UNK UNK 's hands had been tied with a bump and towel placed over a face .", "police in UNK are waiting for results of forensic tests to confirm that sister UNK was sexually assaulted ."], "article_lines": ["Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher\u00a0(not pictured) was found in her bedroom, with a towel on her face", "An 86-year-old nun was reportedly gang-raped before being murdered in her bedroom at a South African missionary.", "Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police.", "Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban.", "Police in KwaZulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted.", "They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her.", "A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room.", "The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's\u00a0Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission.\u00a0", "We worked very closely together.", "She loved her work with children.
