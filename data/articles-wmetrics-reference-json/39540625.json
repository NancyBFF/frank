I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.\"One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.\"Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well.
