Marie Teresa Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against a raft of misconduct charges, choosing not to show up at her fitness to practise hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). She also declined to send a lawyer in her place. The panel has been told Ms Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations relating to her care and treatment of 14 patients at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital in Cumbria between February 2004 and September 2013. Former midwife Marie Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against 77 misconduct charges at a fitness to practise hearing in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She worked at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital where Joshua Titcombe, pictured, died at just nine days old They include the allegations that, in relation to two babies - one of whom died in February 2004 and another in September 2008 - Ms Ratcliffe's conduct 'contributed to the death' of, and/or caused the patient's baby 'to lose a significant chance of survival'. The allegations against Ms Ratcliffe also included claims she failed to adequately monitor patients, record key observations in patient notes or request assistance from doctors. Amanda Hamilton, representing the NMC, read out a letter written by Ms Ratcliffe which said that she will 'regret what happened for the rest of my life'. Ms Ratcliffe told the panel she is no longer a midwife, and has no intentions of returning to the profession. In the letter read to the NMC panel, sitting in Stratford, east London, Ms Ratcliffe said: 'I am a human being of good will and I accept that I have made mistakes and apologise to those affected by them.' In the letter, Ms Ratcliffe said she felt 'it was important not to delay' proceedings any further or efforts for people to look in to what happened by 'defending myself against these charges'. She denied being part of any cover-up or collusion of what had happened or effort to 'conceal the truth'. In March, an independent investigation into what happened at Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, found failures led to the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother Marie Ratcliffe is the first of eight midwives accused of misconduct and poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust to appear before the NMC. In March, the independent inquiry into the failings at Morecambe Bay, led by Bill Kirkup, found failures at the trust led to the avoidable deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Feuding medics, an obsession with natural childbirth, and a tight knit group of midwives who dubbed themselves 'The Musketeers' contributed to a 'distressing chain of events' which led to avoidable harm to mothers and babies, at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The independent investigation into serious incidents at the hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered a series of failures 'at every level' - from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust which runs the unit. The report slammed the clinical competence of staff, a 'them and us' culture between midwives, obstetricians and paeditricians and an over-zealous pursuit of natural childbirth 'at all costs' by a small group of dominant midwives. It found 'shocking' substandard clinical competence, extremely poor working relationships between different staff groups and repeated failure to investigate adverse incidents properly and learn lessons. And the report suggests that when babies died, midwives conspired to cover up the failings. In total eight midwives who worked at the trust could face disciplinary action. The NMC said last year that four midwives should face hearings. Meanwhile another four midwives are still the subject of further investigations. She noted that the system had been flawed but that she was governed by those procedures. She stated that 'in writing these words I seek no leniency' adding 'I accept things I cannot change.' Panel chairman Gary Leong said: 'By her letter Ms Ratcliffe is aware of the proceedings. 'She has voluntarily absented herself. She is very clear that she does not wish to defend herself against these charges. 'In light of that the panel considers that an adjournment would not change the circumstances. She does not wish to come.' He said the hearing is a matter of public interest, and as such will continue today. The proceedings will hear from two of the women who were under the care of the former midwife when they lost their baby. The hearing was told about the first incident occurred in 2004 in relation to the mother referred to a Patient A. Ms Hamilton, for the NMC, said another midwife present at the birth said the baby 'was placed by the side of Patient A and appeared purple, blue and lifeless'. The baby was taken to a specialist unit in Liverpool Women's Hospital where it died on February 26, 2004. The second death of a baby occurred in September 2008. Other allegations she faces in regards to the Patient B's baby include a failure to record or observe maternal blood pressure and that she failed to adequately monitor and/or ensure the foetal heart rate was normal. The misconduct hearing, which is expected to last a month, will hear from several witnesses including the two patients who lost their children. The hearing heard that Ms Ratcliffe qualified as a midwife in 1990 and in 1997 she was promoted to a Band 7 Midwife at Furness General Hospital, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, where she worked until January 2014.
