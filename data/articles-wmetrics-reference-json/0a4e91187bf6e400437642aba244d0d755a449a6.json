Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports. Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy\u2019s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in. AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday Wright (centre) is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move. A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan. A Sandown spokesman said; \u2018Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony\u2019s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.\u2019 Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy\u2019s sporting heroes from his childhood. Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998 Iconic Arsenal striker Thierry Henry (centre) was asked to present the award but Sky did not allow it Family commitments will keep McCoy away from the Emirates on Sunday when his team host Chelsea in a top of the table clash.
