Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away. 'I knew it was either Summer or our son Sam, who was living in digs in Birmingham at the time while at university. 'As soon as they said Summer's name, I knew something had happened.' Miss Robertson's death came soon after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown. Summer, fourth from left helping to deliver Christmas presents.\u00a0death came just after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown Summer, pictured as a youngster at school, left, and celebrating her birthday. Her family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to her And while they are heartbroken over their daughter's death, her parents say they take great comfort from the fact that she died doing something she loved. Her mother said: 'It has motivated us to want to do something positive in her memory. 'We've decided to take a leaf out of Summer's book, and not take life so seriously. 'Now I don't mind so much if the phone doesn't work. There's more to life than worrying about work and paying the mortgage. 'That's only stuff, as Summer would say.' The family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to Miss Robertson. It came after \u00a31,500 was donated to the appeal through a collection at her funeral. It is hoped they can raise \u00a310,000, which would allow them to name a guide dog puppy after Miss Robertson.
