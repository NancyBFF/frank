But if there is one phase transition in which food can become frustrating \u2013 by giving us brain freeze and by getting painfully stuck to our mouths \u2013 then it is when it is frozen. As a fly \u2013 perhaps the creature you would least expect to be in this position \u2013 found out when it swooped in to have a lick of a frozen beef steak. The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste Like the infamous scene from Dumb and Dumber involving ice, a ski lift and a tongue, the fly becomes attached to the frozen food. Videoed up-close, the fly is initially captured enjoying itself as it fastens its big tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste. Satisfied, it then goes to fly away home when suddenly it notices that it is stuck and a sense of panic sets in. Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera. As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free \u2013 beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly. The fly tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly But nothing seems to work and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost. Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod. Failing this, the video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and ultimately setting it free. The video was recorded in Auckland, New Zealand. The fly appears to give up hope but eventually the video maker intervenes and sets the creature free", "entity_counter": {"the corner": 1, "icy treats": 1, "the menu": 1, "one phase transition": 1, "food": 1, "brain freeze": 1, "our mouths": 1, "a fly": 10, "\u2013 perhaps the creature": 1, "this position": 1, "a lick": 1, "a frozen beef steak": 5, "its tongue": 2, "a taste": 2, "the infamous scene": 1, "ice": 1, "a ski lift": 1, "a tongue": 1, "the frozen food": 1, "its big tongue": 1, "panic sets": 1, "its attempts": 1, "its legs": 3, "the fly": 1, "first attempts": 1, "its back": 1, "all its might": 1, "this two more times": 1, "its annoyance": 1, "the camera": 1, "the video": 4, "help": 1, "the form": 1, "a human thumb": 1, "a little prod": 1, "a little heat gun": 1, "the ice": 1, "Auckland": 1, "New Zealand": 1, "hope": 1, "the creature": 1}, "bart_lines": ["The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste .", "Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak , the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free .", "The video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["the fly was videoed up-close in auckland , new zealand .", "initially it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste .", "the video maker then picks up a heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and eventually setting it free ."], "bus_lines": ["as a fly , the fly becomes attached to the frozen beef steak .", "like the infamous scene from dumb and dumber involving ice , a ski lift and a sense of panic sets in .", "the video was recorded in auckland , new zealand ."], "pgn_lines": ["the fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste .", "the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free .", "it tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs , heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly ."], "s2s_lines": ["the fly is the first to be determined to break free by beating its legs , cracked itself and twisting slightly .", "the fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it UNK its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste .", "the fly is initially featured looking rather pleased ."], "article_lines": ["With summer around the corner, icy treats are back on the menu.", "But if there is one phase transition in which food can become frustrating \u2013 by giving us brain freeze and by getting painfully stuck to our mouths \u2013 then it is when it is frozen.", "As a fly \u2013 perhaps the creature you would least expect to be in this position \u2013 found out when it swooped in to have a lick of a frozen beef steak.", "The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste Like the infamous scene from Dumb and Dumber involving ice, a ski lift and a tongue, the fly becomes attached to the frozen food.", "Videoed up-close, the fly is initially captured enjoying itself as it fastens its big tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste.", "Satisfied, it then goes to fly away home when suddenly it notices that it is stuck and a sense of panic sets in.", "Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free.", "It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance", "it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera.", "As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free \u2013 beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly.", "The fly tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly", "But nothing seems to work", "and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost.", "Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod.", "Failing this, the video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and ultimately setting it free.", "The video was recorded in Auckland, New Zealand.", "The fly appears to give up hope but eventually the video maker intervenes and sets the creature free"], "negative_entity": "Spain", "bart_cased": "The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste .
