Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink \u00a311.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins.com CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 \u00a319.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent. 'You can get the same UVA and UVB protection from cheaper products.' 6/10 Dr Skin's lotion and sun drink comes with liquid food supplement shots, while Ladival is the first product to\u00a0protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB Goldfaden MD Sun Visor Oil Free Spray, SPF 30 \u00a340 for 80ml, Space NK stores CLAIMS: This protects against UVA/UVB rays - it contains titanium oxide, oxtinoxate, benzophenone and organic red tea extract. Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure. 'It's expensive and I'd opt for a Factor 50 product.' 6/10 Mustela is made from a avocado based ingredient, which 'aids development of the skin's barrier Mustela Very High Protection Sun Lotion SPF 50+ \u00a314.95 for 100ml, from independent pharmacies CLAIMS: Avocado Perseose (a patented ingredient based on avocados, which have a high vitamin E content), aids development of the cutaneous (skin) barrier and preserves the wealth of cells in babies' skin. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 Actinica Lotion \u00a319.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 \u00a32 for 50ml, from Wilko stores CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This does what it says on the label. 'It has the same UVA and UVB protection ingredients as other more expensive creams, plus it is water resistant, and easily absorbed.' 9/10 Actinica aims to\u00a0prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients while Calypso contains UVA and UVB protection, is water resistant and won't stain clothes Sun Ceutic 50 Anti-Ageing Sun Protection SPF 50 \u00a331 for 50ml, from uniqueskin.com CLAIMS: This is said to prevent photo ageing (sun-induced skin damage) and sun spots and contains a 'powerful stem cell stimulator'; also contains hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and aloe vera. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream. 'It's not clear what the 'stem cell stimulator' is. 'This is the Holy Grail in skin care as it would reset the clock on skin cells, but I'm not aware that anybody has managed to do this yet.' 6/10 Calypso All School Day Long Once A Day Lotion SPF 40 \u00a317.99 for 150ml, from Tesco, Sainsbury, and Aldi (\u00a37 from Matalan) CLAIM: Contains UVA and UVB protection, it's water resistant and won't stain clothes. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This is OK for a school situation as children are mainly indoors. 'Suncream needs to be reapplied about every two hours if you are out in the sun because the creams get rubbed off - so this is not quite the once-a-day panacea you might anticipate.' 7/10",
