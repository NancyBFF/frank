Doaa and Umm, whose names have been changed to conceal their identities, were\u00a0smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey after leaving the al-Khansa Brigade earlier this year. The pair said they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including giving 60 lashes to those who tried to flee. Scroll down for video Doaa and Umm (above), whose names have been changed to conceal their identities\u00a0have revealed what life was like working for the brutal al-Khansa Brigade In an interview with\u00a0Sky News Doaa, who left after her Saudi Arabian husband blew himself up in a suicide attack, said women also received a 'standard' 40 lashes if they did not wear proper Islamic dress. The 20-year-old, who was paid around \u00a370 a month by the unit, said: 'What upset me most was lashing old women when they weren't wearing the proper clothes.' Umma, 25, was forced to marry a foreign fighter. She said did not see him very much as he was often on the front line. 'Most of the time I would stay at my parents\u2019 house because he wasn't around. He behaved normally, he would come home for two or three days and then go back to fight,' she said, adding that she did not love him. Now the pair, who are living in Turkey illegally, are scared they will be discovered by ISIS fighters who, they believe, are following them. The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. The women revealed they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including those who tried to escape. Above, one of the women shows a picture of herself holding a gun The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. Above, other women from the brigade are pictured holding guns It achieved notoriety last year after women who travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings and lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. In the brigade's first manifesto, released in February, women are told to live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle. It adds that their role should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. While it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS's leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women are treated. Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage showed several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS (above) The women\u2019s revelations come a day after a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya was released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the east of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', were lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others were filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. It followed another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film.", "entity_counter": {"Two jihadi brides": 1, "Islamic State's female police force": 1, "the horrifying punishments": 1, "other women": 2, "Doaa": 2, "whose names": 2, "their identities": 2, "Raqqa": 4, "Syria": 1, "southern Turkey": 1, "the al-Khansa Brigade": 1, "The pair": 1, "others": 2, "the group's rules": 2, "60 lashes": 1, "video Doaa": 1, "what life": 1, "the brutal al-Khansa Brigade": 4, "an interview": 1, "Sky News": 1, "her Saudi Arabian husband": 1, "a suicide attack": 1, "women": 4, "a 'standard' 40 lashes": 1, "proper Islamic dress": 1, "the unit": 1, "old women": 3, "the proper clothes": 1, "Umma": 1, "a foreign fighter": 1, "the front line": 1, "the time": 1, "my parents\u2019 house": 1, "the pair": 1, "Turkey": 1, "ISIS fighters": 1, "an ultra-oppressive police force": 2, "the behaviour": 2, "females": 2, "a picture": 1, "a gun": 1, "holding guns": 1, "notoriety": 1, "the Islamic State's insurgency": 1, "the police unit": 1, "social media": 1, "savage beatings": 1, "lashings": 1, "executions": 1, "managing brothels": 1, "sex slaves": 1, "the brigade's first manifesto": 1, "a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle": 1, "their role": 1, "the service": 1, "men": 1, "their masters": 1, "ISIS's leadership": 1, "a disturbing look": 1, "the way": 1, "a Syrian woman": 1, "a hidden camera": 1, "daily life": 1, "Her footage": 1, "several gun-wielding French women": 1, "their home country": 1, "ISIS": 2, "The women\u2019s revelations": 1, "a shocking new video": 1, "at least 30 Christians": 1, "Libya": 3, "The 29-minute video": 1, "- Clear Evidence": 1, "militants": 1, "two separate groups": 1, "the south": 1, "the east": 1, "At least 16 men": 1, "Islamic State": 1, "the 'followers": 1, "the cross": 1, "the enemy Ethiopian Church": 1, "a desert area": 1, "12 others": 1, "a beach": 2, "another video": 1, "the beheading": 1, "a group": 1, "21 Coptic Christians": 1, "that terrain": 1, "the one": 1, "the latest film": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Doaa and Umm escaped from Islamic State 's female police force earlier this year .", "Revealed they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group 's rules -
