In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video In the beautiful new pictures by\u00a0Gis\u00e8le Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gis\u00e8le Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs Photographs by Gis\u00e8le Freund Texts by G\u00e9rard de Cortanze, Gis\u00e8le Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress \u2026 not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about \u2026 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida. Whilst in the artwork for her latest single 'B**** better have my money' she seems to have copied the artist's eyebrows. Some of the photographs show the inside of Frida's house, some of the walls of which were covered in pictures (left) she also kept dolls on her fireplace (right) There were many interesting artefacts in Frida's house including this turtle which was tucked away under a table Frida stands in the grounds of her gardens, her pose striking against the flora and fauna Frida stands in her garden a long shawl drapped elegantly around her shoulders", "entity_counter": {"A stunning new series": 1, "photographs": 1, "the late artist Frida Kahlo": 3, "part": 1, "a new book": 1, "the images": 1, "The
