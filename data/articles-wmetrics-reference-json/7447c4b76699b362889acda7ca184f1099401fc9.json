Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum", "entity_counter": {"A 78-year-old Connecticut man": 1, "a long criminal history": 1, "the man's lawyer": 1, "the arrest": 2, "a ruse": 2, "the biggest art heist": 1, "U.S. history": 1, "Robert Gentile": 6, "federal court": 1, "Hartford": 1, "Connecticut": 2, "a firearm": 1, "an undercover agent": 1, "His attorney": 1, "Ryan McGuigan": 2, "Investigation": 1, "the theft": 2, "$500million": 1, "artwork": 1, "Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum": 1, "video Robert Gentile's attorney": 1, "his client": 1, "a gun charge": 1, "the $500million art heist": 1, "1990 A security guard": 1, "Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum": 1, "the room": 1, "the paintings": 2, "the massive heist": 1, "This FBI sketch": 1, "a likeness": 1, "the two suspects": 1, "police uniforms": 2, "the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum": 1, "FBI": 2, "the whereabouts": 1, "McGuigan": 1, "others": 1, "long periods": 1, "incarceration": 1, "the Gardner case": 2, "The gun charge": 2, "just an excuse": 1, "Police": 1, "three suspects": 1, "Carmello Merlino": 2, "Robert Guarente": 2, "Merlino": 1, "Guarente": 1, "any knowledge": 2, "the heist": 6, "the missing work": 1, "The thieves": 1, "two Rembrandts": 1, "The Storm": 1, "the Sea": 4, "Galilee": 4, "the only seascape": 1, "the master": 1, "A Lady": 2, "Gentleman": 2, "Black": 2, "Jan Vermeer's The Concert": 1, "approximately 35 known works": 1, "the great Dutch painter": 1, "Chez Tortoni": 1, "Manet": 1, "a man": 1, "a top hat": 1, "a jaunty angle": 1, "the last paintings": 1, "the museum": 5, "Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape": 1, "an Obelisk": 1, "Rembrandt": 2, "the work": 1, "his assistant": 1, "Flinck": 1, "The FBI": 4, "U.S. Attorney's Office": 1, "McGuigan's claim": 1, "place": 1, "two men": 2, "police officers": 1, "the museum's front door": 1, "The guards": 1, "duty": 1, "the pair": 1, "his guilt": 1, "The guards on duty": 1, "chairs": 1, "the basement": 1, "13 artworks": 1, "Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm": 1, "Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert": 1, "A Degas sketch": 1, "a self-portrait": 1, "the items": 1, "The empty frames": 1, "Rembrandt's 'Storm": 1, "Vermeer's 'The Concert": 1, "display": 1, "a constant physical reminder": 1, "the missing masterpieces": 1, "a visitor": 1, "the empty frame": 2, "a Rembrandt work": 1, "Rembrandt's oil painting": 1, "lies": 1, "the floor": 1, "a space": 1, "the wall": 1, "his 'The Storm": 1, "total": 1, "the haul": 1, "three Rembrandt works": 1, "Edgar Degas": 1, "an \u00c9douard Manet painting": 1, "a painting": 2, "the world": 1, "A bronze eagle statue": 1, "a Chinese beaker": 1, "1100 BC": 1, "Govaert Flinck": 1, "a quirk": 1, "the museum founder's will": 1, "the empty frames": 1, "those paintings": 1, "the walls": 1, "Boston longest-unsolved crimes": 1, "two sketches": 1, "mustachioed men": 1, "police hats": 1, "glasses": 1, "one without -
