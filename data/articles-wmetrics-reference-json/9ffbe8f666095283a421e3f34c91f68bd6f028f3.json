Videoed in their front room, the dog named Foxxy Cleopatra and the reptile called Ryuu can be seen chasing after one another around a coffee table. Standing perfectly still while looking in the other direction, the bearded dragon initially appears disinterested as the Chihuahua jumps around excitedly. The video begins with the\u00a0Chihuahua jumping around excitedly while the bearded dragon appears disinterested The reptile then turns to face the dog, causing it to bark, run off and watch from a safe distance behind the table. Without warning, the bearded dragon then charges at full speed towards the dog and forces it to make a quick retreat. Pausing at the end of the table, the reptile waits as the sneaky dog creeps up behind it before pivoting and running after it again. The\u00a0Chihuahua named Foxxy Cleopatra stalks the bearded dragon on a number of ocassions in the video The video maker said that the Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon and loves to chase after him The video maker, named Meo Madeley, can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon becomes even more animated and chases the dog in a circle. Later in the clip the dog creeps up behind the reptile but remains twitchy and nervous as it prepares to run away at any minute. According to the video maker, who is believed to live in Canada, the pair completely love one another. The filmmaker can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon  chases the dog around the coffee table She wrote in the comment section of the original video: \u2018They seriously love to play together. I love to watch them. \u2018Our Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon, she really loves to chase him and our dragon gets excited whenever she comes into the room because he thinks it's time to play. They make us laugh all the time.\u2019 Interestingly however, Ms Madeley also stated that the love is entirely loyal as their other pet hardly gets a look in. \u2018Our beardie doesn't like our cat, so we don't let them play together. He will [only] play with the cat if the dog is around because he really likes our dog,\u2019 said the video maker. He's behind you! The dog creeps  up behind the reptile but remains twitchy and nervous as it prepares to run away at any minute Ms Madeley stated that the reptile doesn't like the family's other pet cat and will only
