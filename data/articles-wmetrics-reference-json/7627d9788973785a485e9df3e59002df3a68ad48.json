Scroll down for video If your name is Nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote Ukip, according to research. Pictured is Ukip leader Nigel Farage The study found that the three names most likely to vote Tory were Charlotte, Fiona and Pauline whereas those least likely to were Sharon, Samantha \u2013 unfortunately for the PM \u2013 and Clare without an i. The three most likely to vote Labour were Michelle, June and Andy and the least likely were Nigel, Nick and Jonathan. The most likely LibDem names were Tim, Kathryn and Samantha. The study comes just a day after it was revealed a Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'.", "entity_counter": {"your name": 2, "Nigel": 3, "the general population": 2, "Ukip": 2, "research": 2, "YouGov": 1, "The figure": 1, "cent": 1, "men": 1, "the poll": 1, "46,000 people": 1, "Joe Twyman": 1, "head": 1, "political research": 1, "the idea": 1, "a person\u2019s first name": 1, "any bearing": 1, "video": 1, "Ukip leader Nigel Farage": 1, "The study": 2, "the three names": 1, "Tory": 1, "Charlotte": 1, "Fiona": 1, "Pauline": 1, "Sharon": 1, "Samantha": 2, "the PM": 1, "Clare": 1, "an i.": 1, "Labour": 1, "Michelle": 1, "Andy": 1, "Nick": 1, "Jonathan": 1, "The most likely LibDem names": 1, "Tim": 1, "Kathryn": 1, "a Ukip election candidate": 1, "the police": 1, "claims": 1, "voters": 2, "sausage rolls": 1, "Kim Rose": 1, "Nigel Farage's party": 1, "Southampton Itchen": 1, "officers": 1, "the snacks": 1, "an event": 1, "snooker star Jimmy White": 1, "Electoral Commission": 1, "state food": 1, "entertainment": 1, "parliamentary candidates": 1, "their provision": 1, "votes": 1, "a criminal offence": 1, "'treating": 1, "Mr Rose": 1, "branded police involvement": 1, "the marginal seat": 1, "their mind": 1, "a sausage roll": 1}, "bart_lines": ["If your name is Nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote Ukip , according to research by YouGov .", "The figure went up from 16 to 31 per cent among men named Nigel , the poll of 46,000 people found .", "The study found that the three names most likely to vote Tory were Charlotte , Fiona and Pauline whereas those least likely to were Sharon , Samantha and Clare without an i."], "bert_sum_lines": ["the figure went up from 16 to 31 per cent among men named nigel , the poll of 46,000 people found .", "the three most likely to vote labour were michelle , june and andy .", "the most likely libdem names were tim , kathryn and samantha ."], "bus_lines": ["if your name is nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote ukip .", "figure went up from 16 to 31 per cent among men named nigel .", "idea was to look at whether person 's first name had any bearing on how they voted ."], "pgn_lines": ["ukip leader nigel farage said the idea was to look at whether a person\u2019s first name had any bearing on how they voted .", "if your name is nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote ukip , according to research by yougov .", "joe twyman , yougov\u2019s head of political research , said the idea was unlikely to ' change their mind for a sausage roll ' ."], "s2s_lines": ["ukip leader nigel farage is ukip leader nigel farage .", "ukip leader nigel farage is being investigated by police over claims he tried to ' UNK influence ' voters by giving them sausage rolls .", "the most likely to vote labour were michelle , june and andy and the least likely were nigel , nick and jonathan ."], "article_lines": ["If your name is Nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote Ukip, according to research by YouGov.", "The figure went up from 16 to 31 per cent among men named Nigel, the poll of 46,000 people found.", "Joe Twyman, YouGov\u2019s head of political research, said the idea was to look at whether a person\u2019s first name had any bearing on how they voted.", "Scroll down for video", "If your name is Nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote Ukip, according to research.", "Pictured is Ukip leader Nigel Farage", "The study found that the three names most likely to vote Tory were Charlotte, Fiona and Pauline whereas those least likely to were Sharon, Samantha \u2013 unfortunately for the PM \u2013 and Clare without an i.", "The three most likely to vote Labour were Michelle, June and Andy and the least likely were Nigel, Nick and Jonathan.", "The most likely LibDem names were Tim, Kathryn and Samantha.", "The study comes just a day after it was revealed a Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls.", "Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White.", "Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'.", "Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'."], "negative_entity": "John", "bart_cased": "If your name is Nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote Ukip , according to research by YouGov .
