The man in his 50s, who has only been named as Mr Zhang, was travelling on his three-wheeled motorbike in Dezhou City in east China when he was hit by a car at a busy junction and thrown off his bike. Villagers from Shoma Ying said that his younger brother had been on the same junction last August, when a collision with a lorry killed him instantly, according to the People's Daily Online. Tragic: The man, only named as Mr Zhang, was thrown off his motorbike when he was hit by a car. He later died in hospital from his injuries Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic. Mr Zhang, who was unmarried, sold vegetables at the local market and was believed to use the stretch of road on a daily basis. Leftover vegetables were found in the trailer after the accident, which was found 30 metres away from the crushed motorbike. Shu Rongli, a police officer from the Dezhou City Public Security Bureau, said that the newly constructed road was not open yet and did not even have road signs. Aftermath: The trailer of the motorbike was found 30 metres away from the main vehicle Poignant: Vegetables sold by Mr Zhang at the local market were found in the trailer after the crash He added that those using it were doing so illegally. The driver in the silver car, who was using a fake registration plate, is under investigation by the police. Shu said that those involved in the accident lacked road safety knowledge, and he reminded motorists to be careful at junctions. Investigation: The driver of the silver car that sped away from the scene is still being investigated by police", "entity_counter": {"A man": 1, "a road accident": 1, "north west China": 1, "his brother": 3, "exactly the same spot": 1, "The man": 2, "his 50s": 1, "Mr Zhang": 6, "his three-wheeled motorbike": 1, "Dezhou City": 1, "east China": 1, "a car": 3, "a busy junction": 2, "his bike": 1, "Villagers": 1, "Shoma Ying": 1, "the same junction": 2, "a collision": 1, "a lorry": 2, "the People's Daily Online": 1, "his three-wheeled motorbike in Dezhou City in east China": 4, "hospital": 2, "his injuries": 2, "Freak coincidence": 1, "the elder": 1, "the two brothers": 1, "The silver car": 1, "the scene": 2, "A driver": 1, "the accident": 3, "traffic": 1, "vegetables": 1, "the local market": 2, "the stretch": 1, "road": 1, "a daily basis": 1, "Leftover vegetables": 1, "the trailer": 2, "Shu Rongli": 1, "a police officer": 1, "the Dezhou City Public Security Bureau": 1, "the newly constructed road": 1, "road signs": 1, "The trailer": 1, "the main vehicle": 1, "Vegetables": 1, "the crash": 1, "The driver": 2, "the silver car": 2, "a fake registration plate": 1, "investigation": 1, "the police": 1, "Shu": 1, "road safety knowledge": 1, "motorists": 1, "junctions": 1, "Investigation": 1, "police": 1}, "bart_lines": ["The man , in his 50s , was hit by a car at a busy junction in Dezhou City .", "He was thrown off his motorbike and died in hospital from his injuries .", "His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["the man , named as mr zhang , was travelling on his three-wheeled motorbike in dezhou city in east china when he was hit by a car and thrown off his bike .", "his brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry .", "the silver car that hit mr zhang on his motorbike sped away from the scene without stopping ."], "bus_lines": ["the man in his 50s was hit by a car at a busy junction and thrown off his bike .", "his brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry .", "he later died in hospital from his injuries ."], "pgn_lines": ["the man , only named as mr zhang , was travelling on his three-wheeled motorbike in dezhou city in east china when he was hit by a car at a busy junction and thrown off his bike .", "villagers from shoma ying said that his younger brother had been on the same junction last august when a collision with a lorry killed him instantly , according to the people 's daily online ."], "s2s_lines": ["the man in his 50s , who has only been named as mr zhang , was hit by a car at a busy intersection in east china when he was hit by a car .", "his brother died in hospital from his injuries ."], "article_lines": ["A man has died in a road accident in north west China -
