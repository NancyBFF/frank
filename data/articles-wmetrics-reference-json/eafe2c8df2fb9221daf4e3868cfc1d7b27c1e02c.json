The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent.", "entity_counter": {"A 20-year-old British tourist": 2, "a taxi driver": 1, "Jaipur": 3, "model": 1, "A taxi driver": 1, "India": 8, "a British tourist": 2, "The driver": 1, "Salim": 1, "the tourist": 1, "Friday evening": 1, "The man": 1, "Todabhim": 1, "Karauli district": 1, "Rajasthan": 1, "custody": 1, "A spokesman": 1, "Rajasthan Police": 1, "statements": 1, "the woman": 1, "her friend": 1, "India Times": 1, "taxi driver Salim": 1, "a complaint": 2, "A spokesman for Rajasthan Police": 2, "Section": 1, "IPC": 1, "Indian Penal Code": 1, "judicial custody": 1, "His arrest": 1, "a number": 2, "incidents": 2, "place": 1, "tourists": 1, "locals": 2, "widespread protests": 1, "a Japanese tourist": 1, "a tout": 1, "Dudu": 1, "The woman": 1, "a tour": 1, "his service": 1, "a guide": 1, "a 75-year-old Indian nun": 1, "a group": 1, "eight robbers": 1, "the\u00a0Convent": 1, "Jesus": 1, "Mary School": 1, "West Bengal state's Nadia district": 1, "a heightened sensitivity": 1, "the issue": 1, "sexual assault": 1, "the moment": 1, "officials": 1, "India's Daughter": 1, "a documentary": 1, "the gang rape": 1, "murder": 2, "an Indian student": 1, "Delhi": 1, "Officials": 1, "India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi": 2, "further disorder": 1, "protests": 2, "vigilante justice": 1, "the brutal rape": 1, "23-year-old student Jyoti Singh": 1, "a bus": 2, "the cinema": 1, "Recent attacks": 1, "street protests": 1, "more protection": 1, "women": 1, "the six men": 1, "the attack": 1, "bus driver Mukesh Singh": 1, "prison": 2, "researchers": 1, "Jyoti": 1, "Her death": 2, "the world": 1, "Jyoti Singh Pandey": 1, "a physiotherapy student": 1, "gang": 1, "hospital": 1, "her injuries": 1, "Vinay Sharma": 1, "Akshay Thakur": 1, "Pawan Gupta": 1, "Mukesh Singh": 1, "death": 3, "her rape": 1, "Ram Singh": 1, "the group": 1, "his cell": 1, "A minor": 1, "a reformatory institution": 1, "angry protests": 1, "misogyny": 1, "The attention": 1, "judges": 1, "the case": 1, "the lawyer's association": 1, "Saket": 1, "the perpetrators": 1, "an angry mob": 1, "video footage": 1, "a man": 1, "the street": 1, "an 11-year-old girl": 1, "Video footage": 2, "the brutal prolonged attack": 1, "a jeering 1,000-strong crowd": 1, "Nagaland": 1, "eastern India": 1, "Ibo Cha": 1, "his injuries": 1, "the girl's body": 1, "woodland": 1, "light": 1, "rapist Syed Sarif Khan": 1, "the streets": 1, "the same area": 1, "a 19-year-old female student": 1, "Nagaland Government": 1}, "bart_lines": ["A 20-year-old British tourist has accused a taxi driver of molesting her .", "The driver , known as Salim , is accused of assaulting the woman in Jaipur .", "Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend .", "His arrest follows a number of incidents of sexual assault in India ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["the driver , known as salim , is alleged to have assaulted the 20-year-old woman in jaipur on friday evening .", "the man , from todabhim in karauli district of rajasthan , is accused of assaulting the woman and is being held in custody .", "his arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in india against tourists and locals , which have led to widespread protests ."], "bus_lines": ["a taxi driver in india has been arrested after being accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman .", "the driver , known as salim , is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in jaipur .", "police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend ."], "pgn_lines": ["driver , known as salim , is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in jaipur .", "the man , from todabhim in karauli district of rajasthan , is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody .", "he was arrested under section 354 of ipc ( indian penal code ) ."], "s2s_lines": ["the man , known as salim , is alleged to have assaulted the woman in lahore .", "he is alleged to have assaulted the 20-year-old woman on friday evening .", "he is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman on friday evening ."], "article_lines": ["A 20-year-old British tourist has claimed she was molested by a taxi driver in Jaipur, who has now been arrested (pictured posed by model)", "A taxi driver in India has been arrested after being accused of molesting a British tourist.", "The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening.", "The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody.", "A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported.", "'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man.
