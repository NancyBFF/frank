A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an\u00a0in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests\u00a0for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to\u00a030 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Pilots have their own separate sleeping quarters, such as this one, on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Looking out over the passengers: Cabin crew can keep an eye on everyone on the flight in case of any issues", "entity_counter": {"Economy passengers": 1, "first class": 1, "lie-flat beds": 1, "nice meals": 1, "the cabin crew": 1, "A new plane design": 1, "the areas": 1, "cabin crew": 2, "rest": 1, "relaxation": 1, "flight": 3, "more space": 1, "any passengers": 1, "A slick bunk bed design": 1, "Zodiac Galleys Europe": 1, "staff": 1, "a bed": 1, "a little shut-eye": 1, "long-haul flights": 1, "video First class accommodation": 1, "Zodiac Aerospace": 4, "their new designs": 1, "luxury sleeping quarters": 1, "The lower deck area": 2, "the sense": 2, "space": 2, "privacy": 1, "flight attendants": 2, "the help": 1, "30 flight attendants": 2, "four different continents": 2, "their lower deck designs": 1, "an area": 1, "maximum personal comfort": 1, "Every bunk": 1, "a personal service unit": 2, "PSU": 2, "crew": 2, "individual comfort features": 1, "order": 2, "innovative materials": 1, "lighting": 1, "solutions": 1, "The Zodiac Aerospace concept": 1, "Hamburg": 1, "the latest developments": 1, "aircraft manufacturing": 1, "Lower Deck Mobile Crew": 1, "Airbus A330/A340": 1, "the market leader": 1, "Each section": 1, "air conditioning": 1, "a clean slate": 1, "a new concept": 1, "sleeping areas": 1, "extensive market research": 1, "The goal": 1, "quantitative aspects": 1, "cost": 1, "weight": 1, "the user experience": 1, "a spokesperson": 1, "Skift": 1, "every step": 1, "the process": 1, "users": 1, "The extensive research": 1, "a thorough understanding": 1, "the factors": 1, "users experience crew": 1, "Cabin envy": 1, "The deluxe areas": 1, "other rare photographs": 1, "the tiny space quarters": 1, "Boeing 373 Dreamliners": 1, "the Aerospace lower deck areas": 1, "the Boeing Crew Rest Departments": 1, "(CRCs": 1, "a compartment": 1, "the top": 1, "the plane": 2, "a hidden section": 1, "the same cabin": 1, "passengers": 2, "Enough room": 1, "a cat": 1, "A file picture": 1, "the Crew Rest Department": 1, "board": 1, "a Boeing": 1, "a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER": 1, "a concealed staircase": 1, "the CRC": 1, "the rear": 1, "Attendants": 1, "room": 1, "eight flight staff": 1, "six foot bunk beds": 1, "heavy curtains": 1, "noise": 1, "other crew members": 1, "Instructions state": 1, "one crew member": 1, "a bunk": 1, "a time": 1, "taxi": 1, "landing": 1, "use": 1, "the secret door": 1, "The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters": 1, "the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Pilots": 1, "their own separate sleeping quarters": 1, "the Boeing 787 Dreamliner": 1, "the passengers": 1, "Cabin crew": 1, "an eye": 1, "the flight": 1, "case": 1, "any issues": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Zodiac Aerospace unveils new design for cabin crew sleeping quarters .", "Each bunk is equipped with a personal service unit -LRB- PSU -RRB- offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system .", "Concept revealed at Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["the deluxe areas were created after zodiac aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four continents .", "the boeing crew rest departments can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane , or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers .", "the company has been creating lower deck mobile crew rests for airbus a330/a340 since the '90s ."], "bus_lines": ["a new plane design has been unveiled by zodiac galleys europe .", "the lower deck area aims to maximise sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest .", "designs reveal a bed each and private privacy for cabin crew ."], "pgn_lines": ["zodiac galleys europe , giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights .", "drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents , their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious , private and air conditioning system ."], "s2s_lines": ["the lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants .", "the lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest ."], "article_lines": ["Economy passengers have long wished they were in first class with lie-flat beds and nice meals, but now it seems there is someone else to envy -
