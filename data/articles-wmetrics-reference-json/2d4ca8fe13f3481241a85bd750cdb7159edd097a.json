The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra \u00a3334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross McEwan said: \u2018This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.\u2019 The latest news wiped more than \u00a3700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin \u2013 nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting \u2013 was even knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. \u2018It\u2019s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.\u2019", "entity_counter": {"Royal Bank": 1, "Scotland": 1, "losses": 1, "taxpayers": 6, "another \u2018tough year": 1, "Royal Bank of Scotland": 1, "the milestone": 1, "a \u00a3446million loss": 2, "RBS": 7, "\u00a3856million": 1, "lawsuits": 1, "fines": 2, "its part": 1, "the foreign exchange market": 1, "other banks": 1, "addition": 1, "the US": 2, "the latest bill": 1, "provision": 1, "customers": 1, "mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts": 1, "the UK": 1, "a \u00a3453million restructuring charge": 1, "a slump": 1, "the value": 2, "premises": 1, "The loss": 1, "a blow": 1, "the bank": 2, "an awkward time": 1, "Chancellor George Osborne": 1, "the General Election": 1, "A return": 1, "both RBS": 1, "state-backed Lloyds": 1, "his claims": 1, "the banks": 3, "the Labour government": 1, "Lloyds": 1, "profit": 1, "the private sector": 1, "the losses": 1, "a long way": 1, "the \u00a346billion bailout": 1, "collapse": 1, "the financial crisis": 1, "Disgraced former RBS boss": 1, "Fred Goodwin": 2, "former prime minister Tony Blair": 1, "Mr Goodwin": 2, "services": 2, "banking": 2, "his title": 2, "Chief executive Ross McEwan": 1, "many conduct and litigation hurdles": 1, "the horizon": 1, "the future": 1, "legacy issues": 1, "The latest news": 1, "shares": 1, "The Tories": 1, "the last Labour government": 1, "check": 1, "its 13 years": 1, "power": 1, "The disgraced former boss": 1, "former prime ministers Tony Blair": 1, "Gordon Brown": 1, "his ruthless cost-cutting": 1, "Jonathan Isaby": 1, "the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance": 1, "These losses": 1, "the liabilities": 1, "the troubled bank": 1, "extremely risky decisions": 1, "extraordinary burdens": 1, "the black": 1}, "bart_lines": ["RBS has racked up \u00a3 50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers .", "The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3 446million loss for the first three months of the year .", "RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3 856million to cover lawsuits and fines ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["state-backed giant reposted a #
