Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood \u2018I think she\u2019s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don\u2019t think she\u2019s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she\u2019s probably doing that advisably, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u2019 Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a \u2018shop window mannequin\u2019 and a \u2018machine-made\u2019 princess who has been \u2018designed by committee\u2019. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn\u2019t have a \u2018single opinion\u2019 of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate \u2018unambitious and bland\u2019.", "entity_counter": {"The Duchess": 3, "Cambridge": 3, "a modern-day suffragette": 1, "the cause": 1, "women": 4, "actress Patsy Kensit": 1, "the comments": 1, "an interview": 1, "this week's Stylist magazine": 1, "Miss Kensit": 1, "the Duchess": 4, "her 'regal inspiration": 1, "Feminist icon": 1, "Patsy Kensit": 1, "'our generation's suffragette' Charity work": 1, "The Duchess of Cambridge": 1, "philanthropy": 1, "feminism": 1, "every level": 1, "outfits": 1, "a shallow thing": 1, "our generation's suffragette": 1, "the first time": 1, "her time": 1, "charity work": 1, "a feminist icon": 1, "plaudits": 1, "her dedication": 1, "children's charities": 1, "The Art Room": 1, "Place2Be": 1, "her demure dress sense": 1, "closeness": 1, "her family": 1, "some criticism": 1, "novelist Margaret Atwood": 3, "Kate": 3, "an 'uneventful dresser": 1, "no match": 1, "Princess Diana": 2, "Suffragette": 1, "Emily Wilding Davison": 1, "front": 1, "the King's horse": 1, "1913 Votes": 1, "Campaigners": 1, "votes": 1, "suffragettes Critics": 1, "princess": 1, "Hilary Mantel": 2, "the 75-year-old author": 1, "people": 1, "the fashion plate": 1, "the only writer": 1, "birth": 1, "her second child": 1, "Double Booker Prize winner": 1, "Wolf Hall": 1, "a \u2018shop window mannequin": 1, "a \u2018machine-made\u2019 princess": 1, "committee": 1, "Sandi Toksvig": 1, "outrage": 1, "a \u2018single opinion": 1, "Joan Smith": 1, "a similar storm": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Actress Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is ` our generation 's suffragette ' First time the Duchess has been hailed as a feminist icon .", "She has been criticised for her demure dress sense and closeness to her family .", "Margaret Atwood said the Duchess is an ` uneventful dresser '"], "bert_sum_lines": ["actress patsy kensit made the comments in an interview with this week 's stylist magazine .", "she appeared in the magazine 's regular ` queen of everything ' feature and said the duchess of cambridge would be her ` regal inspiration ' .", "this is the first time the duchess has been lauded as a feminist icon ."], "bus_lines": ["miss kensit , 47 , appeared in magazine 's regular ` queen of everything ' feature .", "she said the duchess of cambridge would be her ` regal inspiration '", "the duchess is famous for philanthropy but not .", "actress patsy kensit made comments in interview with stylist ."], "pgn_lines": ["patsy kensit says the duchess of cambridge would be her ' regal inspiration ' .", "miss kensit , 47 , appeared in the magazine 's regular ' queen of everything ' feature and said the duchess is ' our generation 's suffragette ' ."], "s2s_lines": ["liz worries duchess of cambridge is ' our generation 's UNK ' .", "says duchess of cambridge is ' our generation 's UNK ' .", "says duchess of cambridge is ' our generation 's UNK ' ."], "article_lines": ["The Duchess of Cambridge is a modern-day suffragette who has done more to advance the cause of women than anyone else in recent years.", "Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine.", "Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'.", "Feminist icon:", "Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level.", "She repeats outfits, which is brilliant.", "I know it's a shallow thing to say", "but I think it's done so much for women.
