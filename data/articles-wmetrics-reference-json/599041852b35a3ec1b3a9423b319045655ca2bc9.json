On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals. But O'Sullivan was also spoken to by the referee Olivier Marteel towards the end of the afternoon session - and warned about his behaviour. Ronnie O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Olivier Marteel in his second round match against Matthew Stevens O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Marteel in his second round match against Stevens at the Crucible Marteel approached O'Sullivan as he walked to the table when Stevens missed a red, telling O'Sullivan he had noticed his hand gesture, which was thought to have been self-directed. O'Sullivan avoided a fine in the first round when he briefly played without shoes after a new pair proved uncomfortable, breaking the rules but not sufficiently to warrant any punishment, after he accepted a substitute pair of size eights, loaned by tournament director Mike Ganley. Stevens reacts to a shot in his match against O'Sullivan during day nine of World Championships Stevens in action against O'Sullivan in their second round match  at the Crucible Theatre The warning from Marteel could be the end of Sunday's matter. Yet any repeat of the incident would see O'Sullivan docked a frame, a tournament spokesman confirmed. Armed with a 5-3 lead from the opening session, O'Sullivan took the opening two frames on Sunday to pull further in front. The next went against the 39-year-old, but breaks of 110 and 139 in consecutive frames suggested O'Sullivan was in unstoppable form, as sweeping through the subsequent three testified. O'Sullivan in action against Stevens in their second round match  at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield Ali Carter continued to struggle in his match against Australia's Neil Robertson. The 35-year-old from Essex, who trailed 6-2 following Saturday's opening session, won the first frame of the day but lost the next five. A finish with a session to spare was possible when Robertson led 11-3, but Carter took the last two frames of the day to avoid that indignity and trail 11-5 overnight. Earlier, Shaun Murphy left Joe Perry with a mountain to climb as their second-round clash got under way, surging 7-1 in front, while Judd Trump built an early 5-3 lead over Marco Fu.", "entity_counter": {"Ronnie O'Sullivan": 13, "more bother": 1, "the Betfred World Championship": 1, "a rude gesture": 1, "his second-round match": 1, "Matthew Stevens": 5, "the table": 2, "the five-time world champion": 1, "a 12-4 lead": 1, "Monday's closing session": 1, "the match": 1, "the quarter-finals": 1, "the referee": 1, "Olivier Marteel": 1, "the afternoon session": 1, "his behaviour": 1, "referee Olivier Marteel": 2, "his second round match": 2, "the Crucible Marteel": 1, "a red": 1, "his hand gesture": 1, "a fine": 1, "the first round": 1, "shoes": 1, "a new pair": 1, "the rules": 1, "any punishment": 1, "a substitute pair": 1, "size eights": 1, "tournament director Mike Ganley": 1, "a shot": 1, "his match": 2, "World Championships Stevens": 1, "action": 2, "their second round match": 2, "the Crucible Theatre": 2, "The warning": 1, "Marteel": 1, "Sunday's matter": 1, "any repeat": 1, "the incident": 1, "a frame": 1, "a tournament spokesman": 1, "a 5-3 lead": 1, "the opening session": 1, "two frames": 1, "front": 2, "breaks": 1, "consecutive frames": 1, "unstoppable form": 1, "Sheffield": 1, "Ali Carter": 2, "Australia's Neil Robertson": 2, "Essex": 1, "Saturday's opening session": 1, "the first frame": 1, "A finish": 1, "a session": 1, "the last two frames": 1, "that indignity": 1, "trail": 1, "Shaun Murphy": 1, "Joe Perry": 1, "a mountain": 1, "their second-round clash": 1, "way": 1, "Judd Trump": 1, "an early 5-3 lead": 1, "Marco Fu": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Ronnie O'Sullivan was speaking to by referee Olivier Marteel .", "The five-time world champion made a rude gesture during his second-round match against Matthew Stevens .", "The warning could be the end of Sunday 's matter .", "Yet any repeat of the incident would see O ' Sullivan docked a frame ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["ronnie o'sullivan is spoken to by referee olivier marteel in his second round match against matthew stevens .", "the five-time world champion fired two centuries in established a 12-4 lead .", "but he was also warned about his behaviour towards the end of the afternoon session ."], "bus_lines": ["ronnie o'sullivan beat matthew stevens in his second round match against stevens .", "referee olivier marteel in second round to reach the quarter-finals .", "o'sullivan is said about his behaviour at the crucible ."], "pgn_lines": ["ronnie o'sullivan found himself in more bother at the betfred world championship after making a rude gesture during his second-round match against matthew stevens .", "o'sullivan is spoken to by referee marteel in his second round match against matthew stevens .", "o'sullivan avoided a fine in the first round when he briefly played without shoes after a new pair proved uncomfortable , breaking the rules but not sufficiently to warrant any punishment ."], "s2s_lines": ["ronnie o'sullivan has made a rude gesture during brawl against matthew stevens in his second round match against matthew stevens in his second round match against matthew stevens at the crucible theatre in sheffield .", "he was also spoken to by referee olivier UNK in his second round match against matthew stevens at the crucible theatre in sheffield ."], "article_lines": ["Ronnie O'Sullivan found himself in more bother at the Betfred World Championship after making a rude gesture during his second-round match against Matthew Stevens.", "On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals.", "But O'Sullivan was also spoken to by the referee Olivier Marteel towards the end of the afternoon session -
