It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea.
