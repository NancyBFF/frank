Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net. Manchester United star Ander Herrera scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa with his eyes shut The Spanish midfielder appears to have his eyes closed as he strikes at Brad Guzan's goal Aston Villa and England midfielder Fabian Delph attempts to block Herrera's left-footed shot His eyes were wide open when he struck an impressive first-time shot against Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup back in January. However his double against Aston Villa and his goals against Queens Park Rangers, Leicester, Preston and Swansea all came without Manchester United's summer signing having to make eye contact with the ball. Herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009 shows. Herrera hits the back of the net while representing Spain's Under 20 side against Tahiti The former Athletic Bilbao joined the Red Devils for \u00a329million in the summer due to his vision and creativity in midfield. Louis van Gaal heaped praise on the 25-year-old's shooting ability after Saturday's Premier League encounter at Old Trafford, by stating:\u00a0'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot.' Herrera's eyes were also shut for Manchester United's third goal against Aston Villa on Saturday His only Manchester United goal scored with his eyes wide open came against Yeovil Town back in January Herrera scored in Manchester United's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers without looking at the ball The former Athletic Bilbao man flicked the ball past Preston's players without having his eyes on the
