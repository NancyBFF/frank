Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges \u2013 who are thought to earn more than \u00a3200,000 a year \u2013 of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the \u00a385 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the \u00a385 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think \u00a385 isn't extravagant. 'An \u00a385 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer \u2013 it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe \u00a385 is not an extravagant amount then what is? \u00a3100? \u00a3200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider \u00a385 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. \u00a385 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge \u2013 Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd \u2013 are all thought to earn around \u00a3202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay \u2013 sometimes for only a few minutes \u2013 in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.", "entity_counter": {"Barry Beavis": 4, "his case": 1, "the Court": 3, "Appeal Millions": 1, "motorists": 5, "spiralling parking fines": 1, "judges": 4, "an 'excessively high' penalty": 1, "a car park": 1, "a legal bid": 1, "his fine": 2, "a landmark ruling": 1, "appeal court judges": 1, "the size": 1, "Motoring groups": 1, "fury": 1, "the decision": 1, "the judges": 2, "touch": 3, "Mr Beavis": 5, "Chelmsford": 3, "Essex": 1, "court": 2, "parking spaces": 1, "a fish and chip shop": 1, "the \u00a385 fine": 1, "a private car park": 1, "the Riverside Retail park": 1, "The car park": 1, "parking firm ParkingEye Ltd": 1, "free parking": 1, "the \u00a385 charge": 1, "the companies": 1, "money": 4, "people": 2, "the fine": 1, "motoring groups": 1, "the ruling": 2, "a victory": 1, "the parking cowboys": 1, "the floodgates": 1, "unscrupulous profit-hungry firms": 1, "the already hefty penalties": 1, "Ian Taylor": 1, "the Alliance": 1, "British Drivers": 1, "An \u00a385 penalty": 1, "a rich lawyer": 1, "less than many charge": 1, "the average hard-pressed motorist": 1, "ends": 1, "a very heavy and unfair burden": 1, "Professor Stephen Glaister": 1, "director": 1, "the RAC Foundation": 1, "parking firms": 2, "a 'blank cheque": 1, "drivers": 2, "This decision": 2, "an extravagant amount": 1, "Our fear": 1, "their penalty charges": 1, "his car": 1, "the Riverside Retail Park": 1, "The retail site": 1, "parking": 1, "Richard Lloyd": 1, "executive director": 1, "consumer watchdog": 1, "the law": 1, "penalty charges": 1, "excessive default charges": 1, "AA president Edmund King": 1, "Britain's motorists": 1, "everyday life": 1, "a reasonable amount": 1, "a parking penalty": 1, "lawyers": 1, "a great deal": 1, "cash-strapped motorists": 1, "a licence": 1, "an open cheque-book": 1, "the figures": 1, "Appeal": 2, "the case": 1, "the Supreme Court Parking trap": 1, "Many motorists": 1, "steep fines": 1, "their allotted time": 1, "The three judges": 1, "the challenge": 1, "Lord Justice Moore-Bick": 1, "Lord Justice Patten": 1, "Sir Timothy Lloyd": 1, "Yesterday ParkingEye": 1, "the judgment": 1, "clarity": 1, "the parking industry": 1, "our parking charges": 1, "These firms": 1, "a moral basis": 1, "as much money": 1, "unsuspecting motorists": 1, "the fight": 1, "Mr Beavis's action": 1, "the Daily Mail": 1, "rogue firms": 1, "fines": 1, "car parks": 1, "hospitals": 1, "railway stations": 1, "shopping centres": 1, "Cancer sufferers": 1, "patients": 1, "whose treatments": 1, "over-run": 1, "the parking firms": 1, "Three judges": 1, "his challenge": 1, "the amount": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Barry Beavis , 48 , from Chelmsford , Essex , was fined \u00a3 85 for staying too long .", "He launched a legal bid to overturn the fine saying it was unfair and unenforceable .", "But Court of Appeal judges said the fine was neither ` extravagant or unconscionable ' Motoring groups reacted in fury , accusing judges of being ` out of touch '"], "bert_sum_lines": ["barry beavis , 48 , launched a legal bid to overturn his fine , saying it was unfair , disproportionate and unenforceable .", "appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ` extravagant or unconscionable ' .", "motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys ."], "bus_lines": ["barry beavis , 48 , lost his case at court of appeal .", "appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ` extravagant or unconscionable '", "mr beavis said #
