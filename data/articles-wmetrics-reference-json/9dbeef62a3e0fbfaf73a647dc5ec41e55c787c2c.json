Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down. Spahic is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday through injury but he could be in line for a longer spell on the sidelines if action is taken after the incident on Wednesday night. Bayer are fourth in the Bundesliga, two points behind Borussia Monchengladbach in the race for a Champions League place and trailing runaway leaders Bayern by 19 points. Spahic tackles Muller on Wednesday, and he has been one of Bayer's star performers so far this season The Bosnian midfielder also appeared for his country during the recently international break against Austria", "entity_counter": {"Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic": 13, "a lengthy ban": 2, "video footage": 1, "a headbutt": 3, "stewards": 3, "a defeat": 1, "Bayern Munich": 1, "the 90th minute": 1, "an ankle injury": 1, "the Germany's DFB-Pokal": 1, "the quarter-final stage": 1, "penalties": 1, "the BayArena": 1, "amateur footage": 1, "the game": 2, "the Bosnian defender": 1, "an altercation": 1, "the side": 1, "the pitch": 1, "pitchside staff": 1, "his friends": 2, "the stadium": 1, "a clash": 1, "staff": 1, "a member": 1, "stadium staff": 1, "the angry clash": 1, "Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm": 1, "the ball": 1, "The incident": 2, "the public prosecutor": 1, "Cologne": 1, "police": 1, "an apology": 1, "his behaviour": 1, "A Bayer spokesman": 1, "a physical dispute": 1, "the final whistle": 1, "a red club top": 1, "two stewards": 2, "members": 1, "his group": 1, "the stadium staff": 1, "the clutches": 1, "the melee Footage": 1, "his hands": 2, "the faces": 2, "the yellow-jacketed staff": 1, "the melee": 1, "multiple stewards": 1, "the brawl": 1, "his side's trip": 1, "Mainz": 1, "the Bundesliga": 2, "injury": 1, "line": 1, "a longer spell": 1, "the sidelines": 1, "action": 1, "the incident": 1, "Bayer": 1, "Borussia Monchengladbach": 1, "the race": 1, "a Champions League place": 1, "runaway leaders": 1, "Bayern": 1, "19 points": 1, "Muller": 1, "Bayer's star performers": 1, "The Bosnian midfielder": 1, "his country": 1, "the recently international break": 1, "Austria": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Bayer Leverkusen lost 5-3 on penalties to Bayern Munich in the DFB-Pokal .", "Emir Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury .", "Footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch .", "The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["emir spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury .", "the defender appeared to fight and aimed a headbutt at stewards after the game .", "footage shows him throwing his hands into the faces of yellow-jacketed staff .", "spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour following the incident ."], "bus_lines": ["bayer leverkusen defender emir spahic could face a lengthy ban .", "video footage shows him fighting and aiming a headbutt at stewards .", "spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury ."], "pgn_lines": ["emir spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards after a defeat by bayern munich .", "spahic was substituted in the 90th minute as bayer crashed out of the germany 's dfb-pokal at the quarter-final stage , losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the bayarena .", "but amateur footage from after the game shows the bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch , where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff ."], "s2s_lines": ["UNK was substituted in 90th minute after 120 minutes in the 90th minute .", "UNK was substituted in 90th minute with an ankle injury as bayer crashed out of the world cup .", "UNK is expected to miss his side 's trip to face mainz in the bundesliga on saturday ."], "article_lines": ["Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after video footage emerged appearing to show him fighting and aiming a headbutt at stewards after a defeat by Bayern Munich on Wednesday night.", "Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena.", "But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands.", "Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final", "The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.
