Charities last night welcomed the move to create a new generation of lifesavers, saying it could prevent hundreds of deaths every year. Previously, only the Liberal Democrats had promised to add the crucial lessons to the school curriculum. But last week Labour, Ukip and the Green Party added their support as they unveiled their Election manifestos. Three more political parties have backed The Mail on Sunday\u2019s campaign\u00a0to add first aid to the curriculum It means the Conservatives are the only major party not to make the same manifesto pledge. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told The Mail on Sunday that the issue was \u2018close to his heart\u2019. He said: \u2018One of my constituents, a very fit 16-year-old called Daniel Young, collapsed and died on the football pitch ten years ago. It really touched me \u2013 as a parent, the trauma of losing a child in those circumstances is incomprehensible. \u2018Our manifesto pledge is about making sure all children are taught basic CPR skills before leaving school. We want to empower a generation of children, and potentially save hundreds of lives. This is about community resilience and people looking after each other.\u2019 Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham (pictured left) said the issue was \u2018close to his heart\u2019 The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first-aid techniques. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. The campaign has support from Schools Minister David Laws, teachers, doctors and leading charities. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan believes schools should not be forced to teach first-aid skills as part of an overcrowded curriculum However, Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists that while first-aid skills are important, schools should not be forced to teach them as part of an overcrowded curriculum. She will instead modernise sex education lessons to include advice on \u2018revenge porn\u2019 and internet safety. St John Ambulance has launched a \u2018promise portal\u2019 to encourage all Election candidates to register their support for the campaign. Richard Fernandez, the charity\u2019s head of public affairs, said: \u2018We have been calling for first aid to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum, so that every child has the chance to learn to be a lifesaver. 'This is a policy that has had backing from individuals in all parties, but it has yet to become reality. \u2018We\u2019re delighted that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip and the Greens have now adopted this policy and included it in their General Election manifestos.
