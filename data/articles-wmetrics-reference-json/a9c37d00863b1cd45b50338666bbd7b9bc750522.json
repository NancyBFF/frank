Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's \u00a35.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from \u00a364 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '\u00a35bn and what do we get? \u00a364 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were \u00a364, some of the highest prices in the Premier League Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '\u00a35bn and what do we get? \u00a364 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's\u00a0Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'. 'In the pursuit of money football has sold it's soul,' he said. 'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices Fans show off a banner reading 'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING' outside the stadium before kick-off 'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it 'cos of the love of our team. 'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we're told to \"sit down, shut up\".' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: 'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.'
