Everton manager Martinez felt Coleman had been barged by home striker Marvin Emnes before the Irish right-back scooped away the ball with his hands. And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used 'common sense' to rule in favour of Everton. Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full-time whistle, but his manager says he was fouled Martinez said on BT Sport 1: 'My thoughts are that straight away there is contact. Seamus tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced. 'Sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense. 'Clearly there's contact. I've seen it many times given as a free-kick. 'The whole action for me is too soft. I don't think that there's enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty. 'He's trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free-kick to be given. The Everton players protest but Michael Oliver deemed Coleman's handball deliberate, and gave a penalty Jonjo Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder equalised for Swansea 'It's one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion. 'You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end.' Martinez labelled the result 'a real disappointment', after Aaron Lennon's first-half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points. Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute. Martinez added: 'The only criticism is we had a period of 10, 15, 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn't find that final shot or try to score the second goal, but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn't reflect what happened.'
