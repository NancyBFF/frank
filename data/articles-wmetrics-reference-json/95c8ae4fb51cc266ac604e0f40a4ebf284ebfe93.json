And like her apparent March 31 email mishap, her game show appearance ended with a very public mistake. McElroy, who teaches legal writing, got tripped up on the $12,500 level after flying through the first few questions, notes Philly.com. Wishes she was a millionaire: Drexel law profesor professor Lisa McElroy allegedly sent a link to a pornographic website to her students. In 2010, she appeared on the TV game show Who Wants to Be a Milionaire Mother of two: The mother of two shared an anecdote with then-host Meredith Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter for her kids and someone to teach her class after learning she was to appear on the show just two days before taping Lost it: McElroy was tripped up on the $12,500 question. Despite having used two lifelines, she answered wrong and walked away with around $5,000 The questions read: 'As a result of General Motor\u2019s bankruptcy declaration in 2009, what foreign government became one of its largest shareholders?' Even after using two of her lifelines to narrow down the answer, McElroy answered China, which was incorrect. The correct answer was Canada. She walked away with around $5,000. McElroy, who is a children's book and biography author, is apparently also a mother. She opened the appearance by sharing an anecdote with Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter after being informed she was chosen to be on Millionaire jsut two days prior to taping. She's accused of sending the inappropriate message this past March 31 under the subject line: 'Great article on writing briefs.' However, when recipients opened the enclosed link, philly.com\u00a0reports that they were directed to a video of 'a woman engaging in a sexually explicit act'. Lisa McElroy, 50, who teaches legal writing at Drexel University, reportedly sent the inappropriate message on March 31 baring the subject line: 'Great article on writing briefs' Following a number of complaints, the college issued an apology to students. The message read: 'As you may be aware, some students erroneously received an email this morning directing them to a... post that included some inappropriate material. 'We take this matter seriously and apologize for any upset it may have caused.' The university says federal law requires it investigate all reports of inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature. McElroy did not immediately respond to an email sent to her university account by the Associated Press. When recipients opened the enclosed link, philly.com reports that they were directed to a video of 'a woman engaging in a sexually explicit act' It's not the first time the married mother-of-two has appeared in the spotlight. She is also an accomplished author with a number of published biographies and children's books. On her website, www.lisamcelroy.com, she describes herself as a 'Supreme Court junkie.' She adds that her favorites ways of relaxing include 'crawling under the covers with a dog or two and a really good book' or 'hanging out' with her two adolescent daughters. Regarding the recent email scandal, David Lat - a lawyer and legal commenter -suggests she could have been 'hacked' or made a 'copy/paste error'.
