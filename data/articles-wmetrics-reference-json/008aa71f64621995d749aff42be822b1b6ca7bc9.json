An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday \u2018I\u2019d be over the moon to get it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked hard towards,\u2019 said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. \u2018I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. \u2018I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. \u2018I\u2019ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. \u2018Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I\u2019ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. \u2018There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.\u2019 Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock \u2014 Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O\u2019Hara \u2014 who will become free agents this summer. \u2018I\u2019ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. \u2018You can\u2019t do that until you are the main man.\u2019", "entity_counter": {"Gary Locke": 3, "Kilmarnock\u2019s permanent manager": 1, "charge": 3, "An announcement": 1, "the Rugby Park club": 3, "Friday morning": 1, "the former Hearts boss": 1, "a three-year deal": 1, "the 39-year-old paid tribute": 1, "the players": 4, "whose efforts": 1, "favour": 1, "new chairman Jim Mann": 1, "Allan Johnston": 1, "a caretaker basis": 1, "Kilmarnock": 4, "the club's new permanent manager": 1, "the moon": 1, "negotiations": 1, "a taste": 1, "(management": 1, "Hearts": 1, "this position": 1, "a great club": 1, "a fantastic opportunity": 1, "players": 1, "a better reputation": 1, "a manager": 1, "the case": 1, "a great response": 1, "football": 1, "your stock": 1, "the manager": 2, "the stick": 1, "broad shoulders": 1, "board": 1, "Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke": 1, "head coach": 1, "Coaches": 1, "Alan Robertson": 1, "Billy Thomson": 1, "a fantastic job": 1, "these things": 1, "backroom staff": 1, "these people": 1, "Locke": 2, "Rugby Park": 1, "Johnston": 2, "the club": 5, "the \u00a3150,000 sale": 1, "Robbie Muirhead": 1, "Dundee United": 1, "a factor": 1, "his decision": 1, "his duties": 1, "the club hierarchy": 1, "assistant Locke": 3, "a stop-gap appointment": 1, "a team": 1, "the league": 1, "their first six games": 1, "his stewardship": 1, "their first reverse": 1, "Ross County": 1, "Locke's first six games": 1, "Mann": 1, "results": 1, "the way": 3, "his two months": 1, "the helm": 1, "the Premiership": 1, "the hunt": 1, "a top-six place": 1, "reports": 1, "talks": 1, "a clause": 1, "a top-six finish": 1, "contracts": 1, "a bit": 1, "time": 1, "any problems": 1, "a hold-up": 1, "any player": 1, "manager": 1, "the terms": 1, "a contract": 1, "a lot": 2, "things": 1, "no complaints": 1, "our home game": 1, "Motherwell": 1, "Our new board": 1, "directors": 1, "The club": 1, "plans": 1, "place": 1, "loads": 1, "positives": 1, "part": 1, "his own situation": 1, "his attention": 1, "the futures": 1, "nine first-team players": 1, "Manuel Pascali": 1, "Alexei Eremenko": 1, "Craig Slater": 1, "Craig Samson": 1, "Sammy Clingan": 1, "Greg Kiltie": 1, "Conor Brennan": 1, "Chris Chantler": 1, "Mark O\u2019Hara": 1, "free agents": 1, "my own position": 1, "a few players": 1, "contract": 1, "their futures": 1, "the main man": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock 's permanent manager on Friday .", "Locke replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February .", "The 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since taking charge ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["gary locke will be confirmed as kilmarnock 's permanent manager on friday .", "the 39-year-old has been given a three-year deal at kilmarnock .", "locke had been working as no 2 under allan johnston when the manager announced in february that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season ."], "bus_lines": ["gary locke will be confirmed as kilmarnock 's permanent manager on friday -
