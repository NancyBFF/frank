Abase Hussen \u2013 who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year \u2013 conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of \u2018nothing\u2019 to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 Abase Hussen, circled, \u00a0marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies \u2013 with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. \u2018The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,\u2019 he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: \u2018We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.\u2019 Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: \u2018Not at all. Nothing.\u2019 Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u2018Remember that Amira Abase\u2019s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.\u2019 Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: \u2018I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.\u2019 Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: \u2018The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.\u2019 Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came \u2018for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English\u2019. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was \u2018just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists\u2019. Mr Hussen said he felt \u2018terrible\u2019 to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby\u2019s killers and said: \u2018It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 Amira fled to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs\u2019 committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: \u2018I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. \u2018It\u2019s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply
