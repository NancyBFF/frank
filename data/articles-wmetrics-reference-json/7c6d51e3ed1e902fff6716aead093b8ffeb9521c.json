According to two popular online measuring tools, no more than 44 per cent of her Twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform. And at least 15 per cent \u2013 more than 544,000 \u2013 are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half\u00a0of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,'\u00a0according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF? A woman cast as a kindly, gardening grandma in Clinton's campaign launch video is actually a former abortion lobbyist who once helmed a campaign for Texas state Senator Wendy Davis WHERE'S SCOOBY? Clinton's caravan was spotted in Maumee, Ohio on Monday when she lunched at Chipotle, but no one recognized her Facebook says it has entire teams of employees tasked with rooting out schemes to artificially boost statistics. 'When we catch fraudulent activity, we work to counter and prevent it \u2013 including blocking accounts and removing fake likes,' the company reports on its website. Clinton is in Monticello, Iowa on Tuesday for the first stop on her nascent presidential 'listening' tour. She was driven from New York in a van that her campaign aides have dubbed 'Scooby,' after the 'Mystery Machine' van in the Scooby-Doo cartoon series. Daily Mail Online visited Kirkwood Community College on Monday, the site of the event, and heard from students that the former first lady is a 'control freak' who may be pursuing legal status for illegal immigrants because the Democratic Party needs a new pool of loyal voters.", "entity_counter": {"Hillary Clinton": 6, "a robust 3.6 million Twitter followers": 1, "not even a vast right-wing conspiracy": 1, "two popular online measuring tools": 1, "her Twitter fan base": 1, "real people": 2, "the social media platform": 2, "StatusPeople.com": 1, "the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool": 1, "state": 1, "any tweets": 1, "VIDEO FAKERS": 1, "one popular online audit tool": 1, "only 44 per cent": 1, "Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers": 1, "I'M": 1, "PRESIDENT": 1, "a champion": 1, "everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website": 1, "Clinton's followers": 1, "a much larger number": 1, "President Barack Obama's Twitter followers": 1, "comparison": 1, "The White House": 1, "overtime": 1, "a September 2013 report": 1, "the former secretary of state's followers": 1, "Michelle Obama's Twitter audience": 1, "StatusPeople": 1, "Vice President Joe Biden": 1, "Another tool": 1, "TwitterAudit.com": 1, "Mrs. Clinton's followers": 1, "The new measurements": 1, "the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment": 1, "news": 1, "a large number": 1, "her Facebook fans": 1, "'likes": 1, "Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count": 1, "significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY": 1, "a million Facebook 'likes": 1, "Baghdad": 2, "their hometown": 2, "Vocativ": 1, "Iraq": 1, "a larger number": 1, "any U.S. city": 1, "more than 46,000 people": 1, "Additional evidence": 1, "digital astroturfing": 1, "most of her U.S. Facebook fans": 1, "the Baghdad contingent": 1, "the 18-34 age range": 1, "America's top diplomat": 1, "her State Department": 1, "an Associated Press report": 1, "the State Department": 1, "more than 400,000 likes": 1, "Cairo": 1, "Facebook fans": 1, "its inspector general": 2, "a million Facebook '": 4, "the numbers": 1, "the wire service": 1, "ASTROTURF": 1, "A woman": 1, "grandma": 1, "Clinton's campaign launch video": 1, "a former abortion lobbyist": 1, "a campaign": 1, "Texas state Senator Wendy Davis": 1, "SCOOBY": 1, "Clinton's caravan": 1, "Maumee": 1, "Ohio": 1, "Chipotle": 1, "no one": 1, "entire teams": 1, "employees": 1, "schemes": 1, "statistics": 1, "fraudulent activity": 1, "accounts": 1, "fake likes": 1, "its website": 1, "Monticello": 1, "Iowa": 1, "the first stop": 1, "her nascent presidential 'listening' tour": 1, "New York": 1, "a van": 1, "her campaign aides": 1, "the 'Mystery Machine' van": 1, "the Scooby-Doo cartoon series": 1, "Daily Mail Online": 1, "Kirkwood Community College": 1, "the site": 1, "the event": 1, "students": 1, "the former first lady": 1, "a 'control freak": 1, "legal status": 1, "illegal immigrants": 1, "the Democratic Party": 1, "a new pool": 1, "loyal voters": 1}, "bart_lines": ["StatusPeople.com , the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool , reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state 's followers are ` good ' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton 's followers and found that a much larger number of them were ` fake ' Clinton is in Monticello , Iowa for the first stop on her nascent presidential ` listening ' tour ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["no more than 44 per cent of hillary clinton 's twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform .", "at least 15 per cent -- more than 544,000 -- are completely fake .", "one twitter sleuthing website sampled 320,000 of her followers and found that a much larger number of them were ` fake ' ."], "bus_lines": ["no more than 44 per cent of her twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform .", "44 % of the former secretary of state 's followers are ` good ' , and 41 per cent are ` inactive ' clinton 's twitter audience is 25 per cent fake .", "at least 7 per cent were fake ."], "pgn_lines": ["hillary clinton boasts a robust 3.6 million twitter followers .", "only 44 per cent of her twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform .", "statuspeople.com , the oldest publicly available twitter-auditing tool , reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state 's followers are ' good ' ;
