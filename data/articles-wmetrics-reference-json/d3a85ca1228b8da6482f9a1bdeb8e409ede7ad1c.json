Bikini model Alexis Randock posted this photo on her Instagram account of her and sister Nicole on the beach last week PGA Tour star Rickie Fowler, right, has earned extra brownie points with his growing legion of fans after calling out an online hater who accused his girlfriend Alexis Randock, left, of being a 'gold digger' 'Must be nice getting s*** free in life and not have to work for it,' he posted. It wasn't long before Fowler came to his girlfriend's defense and responded to the troll that he 'might want to get your facts straight before you talk to my girl friend like that', reports the Golf Channel. Alexis also wasn't shy about standing up for herself. 'That's hilarious. I work my butt off to be able to fully support myself in NYC, I'm out here grinding to live a nice life,' she posted. Fowler received a number of positive comments from other posters who commended him on standing up for his girlfriend. 'Fatalsplash' - who has since changed his user name to - '@dont_hava_usename' - was roundly criticized, being called a moron and accused of working at McDonald's.
