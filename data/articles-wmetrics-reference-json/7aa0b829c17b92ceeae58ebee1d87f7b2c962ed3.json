In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers.

Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look.
