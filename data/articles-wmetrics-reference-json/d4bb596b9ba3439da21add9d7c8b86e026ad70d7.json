Davis, 21, had lost her only career meeting with Bouchard, but was in control this time against the world No 7. Davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke Bouchard's serve twice in the final set to pull off the upset. Eugenie Bouchard fires down a serve during her second-round match at the Family Circle Cup Bouchard shows her frustrations during her straight-sets defeat by Lauren Davis on Wednesday 'I've never beaten here before, so I came out knowing I had nothing to lose,' said Davis, ranked 66th in the world. Bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the Charlston green-clay event, losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents. Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set. Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead. Davis hits a forehand on her way to an impressive win against the Canadian top seed Bouchard has struggled recently, this time slumping to her fourth defeat in six matches The match ended on Bouchard's forehand into the net, Davis waving to the cheering crowd. Bouchard said: 'As soon as it was over, definitely a bit of anger, but also kind of this confusion, slash, like quest to find what's wrong, like this kind of searching feeling that, 'OK, like I know something's off.' 'I know something's not right. So I want to find it. I was definitely a little bit slow today, overpowered. 'Usually, I'm the one dominating. So it was definitely, just, I don't know, just not good.'", "entity_counter": {"Eugenie Bouchard's run": 1, "poor form": 1, "the top seed": 1, "American Lauren Davis": 9, "the second round": 1, "the Family Circle Cup": 1, "Charleston": 1, "Davis": 1, "her only career meeting": 1, "Eugenie Bouchard's": 1, "control": 1, "the world": 2, "the final 11 games": 1, "the match": 1, "Bouchard's serve": 2, "the final set": 1, "the upset": 1, "Eugenie Bouchard": 5, "a serve": 1, "her second-round match": 1, "the Family Circle Cup Bouchard": 1, "her frustrations": 1, "her straight-sets defeat": 1, "the lead-up": 1, "the Charlston green-clay event": 1, "her last five matches": 1, "lower-ranked opponents": 1, "precise groundstrokes": 1, "her heels": 1, "the second set": 1, "a 3-1 lead": 1, "the 21-year-old Canadian": 1, "a double fault": 1, "a forehand": 2, "a backhand": 1, "Bouchard's 102mph": 1, "a winner": 1, "the left sideline": 1, "a 5-1 lead": 1, "her way": 1, "an impressive win": 1, "the Canadian top seed": 1, "her fourth defeat": 1, "six matches": 1, "The match": 1, "Bouchard's forehand": 1, "the net": 1, "the cheering crowd": 1, "anger": 1, "this confusion": 1, "quest": 1, "this kind": 1, "the one": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Eugenie Bouchard was beaten 6-3 , 6-1 by Lauren Davis at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston on Wednesday .", "Davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match .", "The 21-year-old American won her only career meeting with the Canadian ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["eugenie bouchard was beaten 6-3 , 6-1 by lauren davis in the second round at the family circle cup in charleston .", "davis , 21 , had lost her only career meeting with bouchard , but was in control this time against the world no 7 .", "bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the charlston green-clay event , losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents ."], "bus_lines": ["eugenie bouchard beat lauren davis 6-3 in the second round at the family circle cup on wednesday .", "davis , 21 , had lost her only career meeting with bouchard .", "davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match ."], "pgn_lines": ["eugenie bouchard 's run of poor form continued as the top seed was beaten 6-3 , 6-1 by american lauren davis in the second round at the family circle cup in charleston on wednesday .", "davis , 21 , had lost her only career meeting with bouchard , but was in control this time against the world no 7 .", "davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke bouchard 's serve twice in the final set to pull off the upset ."], "s2s_lines": ["bouchard beats lauren davis in the second round at the family circle cup .", "bouchard won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke her serve twice .", "bouchard won nine of the final 11 games of the match ."], "article_lines": ["Eugenie Bouchard's run of poor form continued as the top seed was beaten 6-3, 6-1 by American Lauren Davis in the second round at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston on Wednesday.", "Davis, 21, had lost her only career meeting with Bouchard, but was in control this time against the world", "No 7.", "Davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke Bouchard's serve twice in the final set to pull off the upset.", "Eugenie Bouchard fires down a serve during her second-round match at the Family Circle Cup Bouchard shows her frustrations during her straight-sets defeat by Lauren Davis on Wednesday 'I've never beaten here before, so I came out knowing I had nothing to lose,' said Davis, ranked 66th in the world.", "Bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the Charlston green-clay event, losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents.", "Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set.", "Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind.", "Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead.", "Davis hits a forehand on her way to an impressive win against the Canadian top seed Bouchard has struggled recently, this time slumping to her fourth defeat in six matches The match ended on Bouchard's forehand into the net, Davis waving to the cheering crowd.", "Bouchard said: 'As soon as it was over, definitely a bit of anger, but also kind of this confusion, slash, like quest to find what's wrong, like this kind of searching feeling that, 'OK, like I know something's off.'", "'", "I know something's not right.", "So I want to find it.", "I was definitely a little bit slow today, overpowered.
