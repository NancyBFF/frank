May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.", "entity_counter": {"Mary Pat Christie": 4, "her big-money job": 1, "Wall Street": 2, "a sign": 2, "her husband": 2, "president": 3, "Pat Christie": 1, "a managing director": 1, "New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon": 1, "Co": 1, "$475,000-a-year position": 2, "a family spokesman": 1, "The official reason": 1, "the resignation": 1, "more time": 1, "her family": 1, "young children": 1, "the move": 1, "New Jersey governor Christie": 1, "the Republican nomination": 1, "the 2016 presidential election": 1, "video": 1, "finance firm Angelo Gordon": 1, "Fox Business": 1, "colleagues": 1, "her leaving": 1, "a precursor": 2, "her husband's run": 1, "the campaign trail": 1, "a recent appearance": 1, "New Hampshire": 2, "a necessary stop": 1, "would-be presidents": 1, "the Christies": 1, "Mary Pat": 1, "her job": 2, "the chances": 1, "her quitting": 1, "a career": 1, "a big sacrifice": 1, "a spouse": 1, "a requirement": 1, "The move": 1, "Christie's bid": 1, "a lot": 2, "campaigning": 1, "Mrs Christie": 1, "another Wall Street Republican spouse -
