' 'Inspiration Centraal' - the free event hosted by Dutch hosting company TransIP - has so far seen more than 3,500 technology enthusiasts attend to hear talks from some of London's most successful startup entrepreneurs, including MindCandy founder Michael Acton-Smith and 'gaming industry godfather' Ian Livingstone. The eight day event, was been staged to celebrate the UK launch of Dutch VPS, hosting and domain name company TransIP. The dancers, which cost around \u00a32,500 to hire, were made out of old car parts and were designed by British artist Giles Walker , with their moves controlled by a computer. 'We chose Shoreditch and Tech City quite deliberately as our new home, as we are a fan of London's growing stature as an international technology hub, but frankly our expectations have been exceeded by the level of engagement we've experienced from the startup community in this beautiful city,' said TransIP CEO Jeroen H\u00fcpscher.
