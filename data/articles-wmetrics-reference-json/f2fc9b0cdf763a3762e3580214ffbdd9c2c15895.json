Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\u00a0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\u00a0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\u00a0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\u00a0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said. 'He suffers from depression and has alcohol issues. He\u00a0recognises that he needs help.' Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found\u00a0guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting\u00a0his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a\u00a0three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening\u00a0manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her,\u00a0you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to\u00a0the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get\u00a0to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of\u00a0those photos.'", "entity_counter": {"Jason Cotterill": 3, "explicit revenge porn images": 2, "his ex partner": 1, "her children": 2, "67 Facebook profiles": 2, "abuse A jilted lover": 1, "his ex-partner": 1, "her daughter": 5, "abuse": 1, "his victim": 5, "abusive messages": 1, "the internet": 2, "their relationship": 1, "A court": 1, "a link": 4, "an online sex video": 2, "her Facebook page": 2, "childhood": 2, "sex tapes": 2, "Birmingham Magistrates' Court": 4, "the same school": 1, "children": 1, "contact": 1, "Facebook": 4, "three dates": 1, "sex": 1, "just one occasion": 1, "the mother": 1, "a former sex worker": 1, "the liaison": 1, "her lover": 7, "'creepy' messages": 1, "the defendant": 1, "a result": 1, "her mobile phone number": 1, "the trial": 1, "67 different Facebook": 1, "an attempt": 1, "the social networking site": 1, "different profiles": 1, "messages": 2, "my family messages": 1, "my friends": 1, "medication": 1, "His language": 1, "The victim": 4, "pictures": 1, "her family": 1, "friends": 1, "an x-rated explicit video": 1, "a message": 1, "my profile picture": 1, "some more pictures": 1, "depression and panic attacks": 1, "'disgusting' messages": 1, "Cotterill": 1, "two previous\u00a0convictions": 1, "harassment": 3, "the link": 1, "Oldbury": 2, "a trial": 2, "problems": 1, "relationships": 1, "David Houldcroft": 1, "depression": 1, "alcohol issues": 1, "help": 1, "District Judge David Robinson": 1, "the complainant": 1, "a\u00a0three-month period": 1, "social networks": 1, "a threatening\u00a0manner": 1, "a number": 1, "aggravating features": 1, "this case": 1, "Facebook profiles": 1, "touch": 1, "a pornographic site": 1, "use": 1, "others": 1, "a link to a pornographic site": 1, "the woman's friends": 1, "her sister": 1, "the photos": 2, "the power": 1, "the knowledge": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Jason Cotterill , 42 , plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year .", "He also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in -
