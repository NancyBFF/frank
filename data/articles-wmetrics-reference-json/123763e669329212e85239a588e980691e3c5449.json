The memo for members of Congress states damningly that \u2018the UK may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the United States in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the US agenda\u2019. Dated April 2015 and drawn up to brief the Senate and House of Representatives on the impact of Britain\u2019s General Election, the memo also warns that the UK faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament. Scroll down for video The 'special relationship' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan The document \u2013 prepared by the Congressional Research Service, an in-house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators \u2013 states that while Britain and the US are likely to \u2018remain key economic partners\u2019, a \u2018reassessment of the special relationship may be in order\u2026 because its geopolitical setting has been changing\u2019. The memo, edited by Derek E Mix, the CRS\u2019s chief European affairs analyst, says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the \u2018influence and centrality of the relationship\u2019. It also states that the UK\u2019s continued importance to the US will hinge on the future success of the economy \u2013 and Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s implementation of spending cuts. It reads: \u2018A significant degree of the UK\u2019s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy, further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation.\u2019 Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food  during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011.\u00a0When Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was \u2018stronger than it has ever been\u2019 Winston Churchill first coined the phrase 'special relationship' in a speech in 1944 The \u2018special relationship\u2019 has been deployed by generations of politicians \u2013 most notably Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher \u2013 to describe the close political, diplomatic, cultural, economic, military and historical relations between the two countries. It was first coined in a 1944 speech by Winston Churchill, when he said it was his \u2018deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship\u2026 another destructive war will come to pass\u2019. Increasingly, however, the relationship has come to be seen as one-sided, with British Prime Ministers more keen to flag up the alliance than US Presidents. When David Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was \u2018stronger than it has ever been\u2019. The memo also expresses concern about a potential UK exit from the EU following an \u2018Out\u2019 vote in any referendum, saying: \u2018Both the positive and the negative aspects of a prospective life outside the EU are more difficult to foresee.\u2019 Explaining the significance of a hung parliament, the congressional document says it could result in a \u2018brief period of ambiguity\u2019
