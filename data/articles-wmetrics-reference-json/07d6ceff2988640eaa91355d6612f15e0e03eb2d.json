The golfer's girlfriend, bikini model Alexis Randock, had posted a photo on her Instagram account of her and sister Nicole on the beach last week. The photo was shared with her 25,000 followers, which included an abusive commenter known as 'fatalsplash' who was quick to judge and accused Alexis of being a 'gold digger.'

It wasn't long before Fowler came to his girlfriend's defence and responded to the troll that he 'might want to get your facts straight before you talk to my girl friend like that', reports the Golf Channel.

Fowler received a number of positive comments from other posters who commended him on standing up for his girlfriend. 'Fatalsplash' - who has since changed his user name to - '@dont_hava_usename' - was roundly criticised, being called a moron and accused of working at McDonald's.
