But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'", "entity_counter": {"Emma Jackson": 2, "a quiet cul-de-sac": 1, "Hull": 2, "the perfect place": 1, "her dream home": 1, "a nightmare": 1, "an aggressive neighbour": 1, "a penchant": 1, "TV": 1, "the volume": 1, "the racket": 1, "the photography student": 1, "unemployed Mark Ray": 1, "a barrage": 1, "abuse": 2, "violent threats": 1, "stalking": 1, "vile verbal abuse": 1, "her neighbour": 2, "Ms Jackson": 13, "Mr Ray": 13, "terror": 2, "her new address": 1, "Ms Jackson's ordeal": 1, "her ground floor": 1, "the previous occupants": 1, "trouble": 1, "the previous tenants": 1, "a problem": 1, "the daily barrage": 1, "noise": 1, "bed": 2, "about 6am": 1, "this noise": 2, "The TV": 1, "full blast": 1, "the point": 1, "The ceilings": 1, "the sound": 1, "the receiving end": 1, "an expletive-laden tirade": 1, "Mark Ray": 1, "a year-long campaign": 1, "Ms Jackson Quiet": 1, "neighbours": 1, "this quiet cul-de-sac": 1, "this explosion": 1, "this tirade": 1, "the first time": 1, "headphones": 1, "order": 1, "any sleep": 1, "vile tirades": 1, "the street": 3, "the garden fence": 1, "touch": 1, "the local Housing Association": 1, "his television": 1, "Mr Ray's new leaf": 1, "breaking point": 1, "the ceiling": 1, "a broom handle": 1, "a cleaning session": 1, "her front door": 2, "a 3ft wooden pole": 1, "Damage": 1, "violence": 1, "photo": 1, "her year": 1, "her life": 4, "the situation": 1, "home": 1, "all areas": 1, "Ms Jackson's life": 1, "her workplace": 1, "Her family": 1, "her step": 1, "mother": 1, "father": 1, "Ms Jackson's home": 1, "the face": 1, "a massive rock": 1, "top": 1, "his bin": 1, "My step-mum": 1, "the fence": 1, "his head": 1, "My dad": 1, "his hand": 1, "my step-mum's life": 1, "The police": 1, "an injunction": 1, "a bit": 1, "any trouble": 1, "his actual personality": 1, "his stick": 1, "his eyes": 1, "the back": 1, "my head": 1, "her wits": 1, "every part": 1, "my studies": 1, "my work": 1, "My hair": 1, "a CCTV camera": 1, "the evidence": 1, "the terms": 1, "the injunction": 1, "a new injunction": 1, "immediate arrest": 1, "a new home": 1, "my relationships": 1, "people": 1, "that type": 1, "person": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Emma Jackson , 28 , moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago .", "But within a week of moving in , her dream home turned into a nightmare .", "Mark Ray , 56 , waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["emma jackson , 28 , moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in hull just over a year ago .", "she thought she had found the perfect place to call home .", "but within a week of moving in , her dream home turned into a nightmare .", "aggressive neighbour mark ray , 56 , waged a year-long campaign of terror against her ."], "bus_lines": ["mark ray , 56 , waged a year-long campaign of terror against ms jackson , 28 , just over a year ago .", "now ms jackson has been forced to move home because of mr ray but says she lives in terror of her new address .", "ms jackson was subjected to vile abuse and was stalked by her neighbour ."], "pgn_lines": ["emma jackson , 28 , moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in hull just over a year ago .", "she thought she had found the perfect place to call home .", "but within a week of moving in , her dream home turned up at all hours of the day .", "now ms jackson has been forced to move home because of mr ray ."], "s2s_lines": ["mark ray , 28 , was met with a barrage of abuse and was stalked by her neighbour .", "she was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated , a year later .", "ms jackson 's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground flat ."], "article_lines": ["When Emma Jackson, 28, moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago, she thought she had found the perfect place to call home.", "But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day.", "Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking.", "Terrified:", "Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour", "Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address.", "Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray.
