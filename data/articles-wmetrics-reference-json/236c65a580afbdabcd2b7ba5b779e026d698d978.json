Katherine\u2019s voice had to be most haunting in its delivery.\u2019 The director also paid tribute to the late actor\u2019s sense of humour and noted that his onscreen chemistry was quickly established with Keniheart on account of the pair discovering that they had both had similar, difficult pasts. Michael Redwood stated that on screen chemistry was quickly established between Peter O'Toole and Nicole Keniheart Director Michael Redwood has a word with Peter O\u2019Toole on the set of\u00a0Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria Redwood said: \u2018Peter managed to politely subdue his mischievousness with Keniheart, but not for long, as she well found out when filming an intimate library scene together. \u2018I'd asked Peter to perhaps whisper something to make Ms Keniheart smile after about 30 seconds of a long tracking shot that contained no dialogue, and what he said did indeed make her burst into a grin, but, what he said could never be printed.\u2019 O\u2019Toole enjoyed a long and decorated career and was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards, received an honorary Oscar, and won four Golden Globes.
