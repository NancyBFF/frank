Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season. The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too.
