People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra \u00a32,100 a year \u2013 \u00a317,800 rather than \u00a315,700 \u2013 to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages \u00a322,100, Prudential\u2019s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that \u00a39,500 \u2013 the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday\u2019s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse\u2019s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce \u2013 usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse \u2013 does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through \u2018pension-splitting\u2019 arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: \u2018Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. \u2018A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. \u2018During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people\u2019s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.\u2019 The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.", "entity_counter": {"People": 2, "a retirement income": 2, "a colleague": 2, "The cost": 1, "divorce": 5, "retirement": 2, "the break-up": 1, "a marriage": 1, "research": 2, "a divorce": 4, "their marriage": 1, "the survey": 1, "the Prudential": 1, "five divorcees": 2, "work": 2, "debts": 2, "their disposable income": 2, "their lifestyles": 2, "The debt": 1, "a divorced retiree averages": 1, "Prudential\u2019s report": 1, "many divorced people": 1, "low incomes": 1, "their careers": 2, "Researchers": 1, "nearly one in five divorced people": 1, "incomes": 1, "the level": 1, "poverty analysts": 1, "the Joseph Rowntree Foundation": 1, "the minimum income": 1, "a single pensioner": 1, "a decent life": 1, "comparison": 1, "people": 2, "the line": 1, "yesterday\u2019s report": 1, "The impact": 2, "a former spouse\u2019s wealth": 1, "divorcees": 1, "retirement age": 1, "The study": 1, "evidence": 1, "the financial effects": 1, "families": 1, "the children": 1, "divorced parents": 1, "school": 2, "risk": 1, "drugs": 1, "crime": 1, "worse health": 1, "parents": 1, "a child": 1, "an independent adult": 1, "studies": 1, "The latest survey": 1, "new evidence": 1, "the financial crash": 1, "husbands": 1, "wives": 1, "children": 1, "loss": 1, "income": 1, "the price": 1, "two homes": 1, "legal costs": 1, "the long-term burden": 1, "maintenance payments": 1, "one spouse": 1, "old age approaches": 1, "the costs": 2, "a former partner": 1, "their children": 1, "a divorced man": 1, "woman": 1, "a share": 1, "their pension": 1, "pension-splitting\u2019 arrangements": 1, "research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat": 1, "the emotional impact": 1, "a shock": 1, "their retirement": 1, "A pension fund": 1, "the largest and most complicated assets": 1, "a couple": 1, "the event": 1, "Professional advice": 1, "the face": 1, "the recent changes": 1, "pensions legislation": 1, "divorced retirees": 1, "advice": 1, "the previous rules": 1, "updated advice": 1, "any post-retirement plans": 1, "legal fees": 1, "the cost": 1, "a new home": 1, "the effect": 1, "any existing retirement savings": 1, "the ability": 1, "a pension": 1, "the period": 1, "many people\u2019s lives": 1, "potential peaks": 1, "the most valuable pension contributions": 1, "The findings": 1, "a survey": 1, "Research Pluse": 1, "7,687 people": 1, "1,012 people": 1}, "bart_lines": ["People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 % higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce .", "It means an extra \u00a3 2,100 a year -- \u00a3 17,800 rather than \u00a3 15,700 .", "One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["people who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 % higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce .", "it means an extra # 2,100 a year -
